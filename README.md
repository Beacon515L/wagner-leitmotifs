# Wagner Leitmotif graph
by Liam Greenough (beacon515@gmail.com)

Interactive HTML5 node graph of leitmotives in Wagner's Ring cycle.  Uses [arbor.js](https://github.com/samizdatco/arbor) and [SVG-Morpheus](https://github.com/alexk111/SVG-Morpheus).

The original version of this graph was traced from interpreting a dependency graph from the [dedicated Wagner Leitmotifs channel of David Sheard.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAqWi_YT0VEkZ41ojy4RAdA)  It also remains a primary source of audio excerpts.  There is a [similar playlist by Jason Pano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK9wrEd88Ok&list=PL66781E476D3C88A1) which I used for comparison.

Subsequently, my primary analytical source became the [absolutely stellar collation by Peter Billam](http://www.pjb.com.au/mus/wagner/), which incorporates the analyses of Roger Donington, William Mann, Lawrance Collingwood and Hans von Wolzogen.  Despite Billam's caution, I have, partly for technical purposes, insisted on creating my own numbering scheme in parallel with 

All musical engravings are my own, and are done using GNU Lilypond.  Some are adapted from Billam's original muscript typsetting via MusicXML to Lilypond; each source file is indicated as this occurs.
